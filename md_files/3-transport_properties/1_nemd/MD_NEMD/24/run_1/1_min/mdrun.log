1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 1 GPU task in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 1 MPI process
Using 8 OpenMP threads 


Steepest Descents:
   Tolerance (Fmax)   =  1.00000e+01
   Number of steps    =        50000

Step 32, time 0.032 (ps)  LINCS WARNING
relative constraint deviation after LINCS:
rms 0.000723, max 0.049528 (between atoms 20792 and 20793)
bonds that rotated more than 30 degrees:

Energy minimization has stopped, but the forces have not converged to the
requested precision Fmax < 10 (which may not be possible for your system). It
stopped because the algorithm tried to make a new step whose size was too
small, or there was no change in the energy since last step. Either way, we
regard the minimization as converged to within the available machine
precision, given your starting configuration and EM parameters.

Double precision normally gives you higher accuracy, but this is often not
needed for preparing to run molecular dynamics.
You might need to increase your constraint accuracy, or turn
off constraints altogether (set constraints = none in mdp file)

writing lowest energy coordinates.

Steepest Descents converged to machine precision in 53 steps,
but did not reach the requested Fmax < 10.
Potential Energy  = -1.3238267e+05
Maximum force     =  6.2013116e+02 on atom 14230
Norm of force     =  4.9506113e+01
