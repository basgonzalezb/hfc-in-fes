# Unveiling Molecular Features Controlling the Solubility of Hydrofluorocarbons in Fluorine-Based Eutectic Solvents

Solubilities of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in three fluorinated eutectic solvents (FESs) has been studied using COSMO-RS and MD simulations. The workflow for this study, and all files concerning the performed calculations, can be found in this respository.
