# Unveiling Molecular Features Controlling the Solubility of Hydrofluorocarbons in Fluorine-Based Eutectic Solvents

This work presents a molecular-level study of the solubility and solvation mechanisms of fluorinated refrigerant gases in fluorine-based deep eutectic solvents (FESs) using a combined COSMO-RS and molecular dynamics (MD) approach. Three FESs based on perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA) as the hydrogen bond donor were investigated to elucidate how ionic and molecular hydrogen bond acceptors modulate the absorption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) such as R-125, R-134a, and R-32. The developed molecular models were validated through computed densities, activity coefficients, and excess Gibbs free energies, confirming the liquid character and thermodynamic consistency of the systems. Structural and energetic analyses, including radial and spatial distribution functions and free-energy perturbation calculations, reveal that solubility is governed by the interplay between fluorinated dispersion interactions, ionic polarization, and PFPA self-association. The main effects determining HFC solubility arise from the specific interactions between fluorinated domains of PFPA and the ionic species forming the eutectic network, establishing a rational basis for the design of advanced fluorinated solvents aimed at the recovery and recycling of refrigerants within a circular economy framework.
